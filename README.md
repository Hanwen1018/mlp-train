## ml-train
General machine learnt potential (MLP) training for molecular systems

#### Install

- ACE:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t-young31/ml-train/main/scripts/install_ace.sh && source install_ace.sh
```



### Notes

- Units are: distance (Å), energy (eV), force (eV Å-1)
- Training using molecular mechanics (MM) is not supported as we've not found it to be efficient
